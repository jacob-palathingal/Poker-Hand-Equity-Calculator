# Poker-Hand-Equity-Calculator
This is a Python-based Texas Hold'em Odds Calculator that computes player equity and hand probabilities using a Monte Carlo simulation. The project provides a GUI built with tkinter, allowing users to input hole cards, community cards, and calculate odds dynamically across different stages of the game (Preflop, Flop, Turn, River).
